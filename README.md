# reDACTED Client
Epic Forge Client Built Upon M.O.O Base. This repository has been archived.
I made this Client back in 2021 for personal use and has now been transferred from my old Github account to my current account.

## How To Download
Put the `reDACTED.jar` in your mods folder and run 1.12.2 Forge.

## Setting up
### IntelliJ
1. In Intellij, navigate to `File > New > Project from Version Control...`
2. Paste `https://github.com/paramkudle/reDACTED/` in the URL field, and hit Clone.
3. Allow gradle to set up the project. This might take a while. (~ 8 minutes)

###### Optionally,

* To generate the run configurations, run the `idea` gradle task.
* To generate attachable sources, run the `genSources` task and attach the generated sources in your IDE.

Download or clone the reDACTED repository.
Run `gradle build`
The built jar is in `build/libs/`.
